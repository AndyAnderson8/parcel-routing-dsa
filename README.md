# Parcel Delivery Routing System

## Overview
University coursework project for a data structures and algorithms course, focused on routing optimization and custom data structure implementation.

The project simulates a local parcel delivery system using a nearest-neighbor routing heuristic and a custom-built hash map for package storage and lookup. It emphasizes algorithmic reasoning, data parsing, and object-oriented design rather than real-world logistics or production deployment.

## Features
- Nearest-neighbor routing algorithm for delivery sequencing
- Custom hash map implementation for package data storage
- CSV-based data parsing for locations, distances, and package metadata
- Simulation of delivery timing and package status updates
- Object-oriented Python design
